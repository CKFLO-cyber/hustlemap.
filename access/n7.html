                                <li><strong>Step 1</strong> ‚Äî Use an iPhone.<br>
                                Buy a cheap iPhone or use your current one. iPhone is a must for this method; Android doesn't pass all checks consistently.</li>
                                
                                <li><strong>Step 2</strong> ‚Äî Region & network setup (choose ONE method):<br>
                                <strong>Method A (recommended):</strong><br>
                                <br>
                                ‚Äì Remove the SIM before you start and keep the phone permanently SIM-free. Do not insert a SIM later.<br>
                                <br>
                                ‚Äì Perform a factory reset.<br>
                                ‚Äì During setup, choose Region: United States or United Kingdom and set the time/date accordingly.<br>
                                ‚Äì Keep Location Services OFF and Bluetooth OFF.<br>
                                ‚Äì Connect to Wi-Fi and lock your VPN to the same region you selected (US or UK).<br>
                                ‚Äì Each day, quickly check that Location/Bluetooth haven't turned back on.<br>
                                <br>
                                <strong>Method B (alternative):</strong> use a US SIM. Tested and it works, but Method A is simpler.

                                They may ask for ID; it doesn't have to be US/UK. You don't need a local bank card; a PayPal account in your home country is fine.</li>

                                ‚Äì Month 2: post 1√ó/day consistently. Posting more doesn't mean more views while the account is still new (trust-building phase).</li>

                                After reviewing your Silver Ticket, go to the ClickBank Marketplace and find a product you want to promote. The higher the Gravity Score, the higher the chances that the product is selling well.<br>

                                Before generating your HopLink, you must set your Affiliate ID (also called "Nickname"). This is the unique identifier ClickBank uses to track all your commissions. Make sure to choose a professional, short name that you'll use across all promotions.<br>

                                Once your Affiliate ID is ready, generate your unique HopLink for the chosen product. This link will automatically track every sale you drive.<br>

                                <li><strong>Step 6</strong> ‚Äî Create new social media accounts<br>
                                After choosing your product, it's time to create new TikTok accounts. The account names should reference the niche or solution related to your product, but never directly mention the product itself.<br>
                                üëâ Example: If your product is about weight loss, instead of naming your account "KetoProductX", use something indirect like "HealthyHabitsDaily" or "FitJourneyTips".<br>
                                ‚Ä¢ Create 1 TikTok account, 1 Instagram account, and 1 Facebook account per device.<br>
                                ‚Ä¢ Always use your VPN set to US or UK before creating these accounts (see your Silver Ticket for detailed setup).</li>
                                
                                <li><strong>Step 7</strong> ‚Äî Build your landing page<br>
                                Once your accounts are ready, you need a simple landing page (also called a bridge page) to connect your content with your ClickBank offer.<br>
                                ‚Ä¢ You can use Carrd to quickly create a clean and professional landing page.<br>

                                <li><strong>Step 8</strong> ‚Äî Add your landing page link to all bios<br>
                                After building your landing page with Carrd, place the link in the bio section of all your social media accounts (TikTok, Instagram, Facebook).<br>
                                ‚ö†Ô∏è Your Carrd landing page must include your ClickBank affiliate link (HopLink) so that visitors are redirected straight to the product sales page. This way, every click from your bio can potentially turn into a commission.<br>

                                <li><strong>Step 9</strong> ‚Äî Create and launch your video content<br>
                                Once everything is set up, it's time to create content that drives people to click the link in your bio. (You already have all the detailed instructions on how to make videos inside your Silver Ticket.)<br>
                                ‚Ä¢ Create 20 videos for Phone 1, 20 videos for Phone 2, and 20 videos for Phone 3.<br>
                                ‚Ä¢ In total, you'll have 60 videos ready.<br>
                                ‚Ä¢ Upload all 60 videos to your social media accounts (TikTok, Instagram, Facebook) as drafts, but do not publish them yet.<br>
                                üëâ When you're fully ready, publish all 60 videos simultaneously across all platforms.<br>
                                This way, you hit the market with maximum impact at once.<br>
                                ‚ö†Ô∏è TikTok may limit each video to around 250 views at first (a kind of shadowban). But that's fine: 250 views √ó 60 clips = massive exposure.<br>
                                ‚Ä¢ After 3 hours, delete all the videos, re-upload them, and post again simultaneously.<br>
                                ‚Ä¢ You can repeat this process up to 3 times per day, every single day.<br>
                                This aggressive posting strategy ensures constant traffic flow and maximizes your chances of going viral.</li>
                                
                                <li><strong>Step 10</strong> ‚Äî Stay consistent and never give up<br>
                                Consistency is the key. If one of your TikTok accounts gets banned or disabled, don't panic. Simply file an appeal ‚Äî in 99% of cases, TikTok will restore your account within minutes.<br>
                                Most beginners quit when their account is closed, thinking it's permanent. The truth is, your account usually comes back within 10 minutes after an appeal.<br>
                                ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: always keep your VPN turned on while managing your accounts.</li>

                            <p>MaxBounty is one of the leading CPA (Cost Per Action) affiliate networks in the world. Unlike ClickBank, where you mainly sell digital or physical products, with MaxBounty you earn money by driving actions ‚Äî not sales.</p>
                            <p>This means you can get paid when someone:</p>
                            <ul>

                            </ul>
                            <p>Because you don't need to convince people to buy something, the process is usually faster and easier than ClickBank. Your focus is on getting as many people as possible to complete simple actions.</p>
                            <p>With the right offers and traffic sources (TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube Shorts), MaxBounty can provide a consistent income stream based on volume rather than high-ticket sales.</p>

                                A MaxBounty affiliate manager will call you directly (usually within a few days) to verify your details and confirm you're a legitimate marketer. They want to ensure you understand how affiliate marketing works and that you'll promote offers in a compliant way.<br>
                                <br>
                                Don't worry ‚Äî this is standard procedure. As long as you answer honestly and confidently, you'll be approved.</li>

                                <li><strong>Step 5</strong> ‚Äî Understand what CPA means & how to find offers<br>
                                CPA stands for Cost Per Action. This means you get paid every time a user completes a specific action through your affiliate link. Unlike ClickBank where you earn on product sales, here you can earn money even if no purchase is made.<br>
                                <br>

                                4. Sort by Payout (how much you earn per action) or EPC (average earnings per click) to find the most profitable offers.

                                After choosing your product, it's time to create new TikTok accounts. The account names should reference the niche or solution related to your product, but never directly mention the product itself.<br>
                                <br>
                                üëâ Example: If your product is about weight loss, instead of naming your account "KetoProductX", use something indirect like "HealthyHabitsDaily" or "FitJourneyTips".<br>
                                ‚Ä¢ Create 1 TikTok account, 1 Instagram account, and 1 Facebook account per device.<br>
                                ‚Ä¢ Always use your VPN set to US or UK before creating these accounts (see your Silver Ticket for detailed setup).</li>
                                
                                <li><strong>Step 7</strong> ‚Äî Build your landing page<br>
                                Once your accounts are ready, you need a simple landing page (also called a bridge page) to connect your content with your ClickBank offer.<br>
                                ‚Ä¢ You can use Carrd to quickly create a clean and professional landing page.<br>

                                <li><strong>Step 8</strong> ‚Äî Add your landing page link to all bios<br>
                                After building your landing page with Carrd, place the link in the bio section of all your social media accounts (TikTok, Instagram, Facebook).<br>
                                <br>
                                ‚ö†Ô∏è Your Carrd landing page must include your MaxBounty CPA affiliate link (HopLink) so that visitors are redirected straight to the product sales page. This way, every click from your bio can potentially turn into a commission.<br>
                                <br>
                                üé• Tutorial on how to insert your MaxBounty HopLink into Carrd: <a href="https://youtu.be/Z0MO5qWLiEw?si=PDjijLKLzrBdh4ZT" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://youtu.be/Z0MO5qWLiEw?si=PDjijLKLzrBdh4ZT</a></li>
                                
                                <li><strong>Step 9</strong> ‚Äî Create and launch your video content<br>
                                Once everything is set up, it's time to create content that drives people to click the link in your bio. (You already have all the detailed instructions on how to make videos inside your Silver Ticket.)<br>
                                ‚Ä¢ Create 20 videos for Phone 1, 20 videos for Phone 2, and 20 videos for Phone 3.<br>
                                ‚Ä¢ In total, you'll have 60 videos ready.<br>
                                ‚Ä¢ Upload all 60 videos to your social media accounts (TikTok, Instagram, Facebook) as drafts, but do not publish them yet.<br>
                                <br>
                                üëâ When you're fully ready, publish all 60 videos simultaneously across all platforms.<br>
                                This way, you hit the market with maximum impact at once.<br>
                                <br>
                                ‚ö†Ô∏è TikTok may limit each video to around 250 views at first (a kind of shadowban). But that's fine: 250 views √ó 60 clips = massive exposure.<br>
                                ‚Ä¢ After 3 hours, delete all the videos, re-upload them, and post again simultaneously.<br>
                                ‚Ä¢ You can repeat this process up to 3 times per day, every single day.<br>
                                <br>
                                This aggressive posting strategy ensures constant traffic flow and maximizes your chances of going viral.</li>
                                
                                <li><strong>Step 10</strong> ‚Äî Why this strategy is powerful<br>
                                This CPA method is extremely simple yet highly profitable. Unlike traditional affiliate marketing where you must convince people to buy a product, here all they need to do is:<br>
                                ‚Ä¢ Download a free app<br>
                                ‚Ä¢ Register an account on a platform<br>
                                ‚Ä¢ Enter their email address<br>
                                ‚Ä¢ Or complete a short form<br>
                                <br>
                                For users, these actions feel quick and risk-free ‚Äî and that's why the conversion rates are often much higher than product sales.<br>
                                <br>
                                The beauty of CPA marketing is that small actions can add up fast. Imagine this:<br>
                                <br>
                                üëâ If just 500 people download a free app through your link, and you get paid $2 per install, that's already $1,000 earned.<br>
                                üëâ With multiple apps or offers, the numbers can scale quickly.<br>
                                <br>
                                In short: it's easier for people to install an app or sign up with their email than to pull out their credit card and make a purchase. That's why CPA can feel easier, faster, and more reliable than ClickBank-style product sales.</li>
                                
                                <li><strong>Step 11</strong> ‚Äî Scaling the CPA strategy<br>
                                Once you've tested a few offers and started making consistent conversions, it's time to scale up and grow your income. Here's how:<br>
                                1. Double down on winning offers<br>
                                ‚Ä¢ If one app or email-submission campaign brings the most conversions, focus on that.<br>
                                ‚Ä¢ Promote it across multiple accounts (TikTok, Instagram, Facebook) to multiply results.<br>
                                2. Use multiple devices & accounts<br>
                                ‚Ä¢ Just like with ClickBank, spread your campaigns across 2‚Äì3 devices.<br>
                                ‚Ä¢ Run several TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook profiles simultaneously for more traffic streams.<br>
                                3. Split-test offers<br>
                                ‚Ä¢ Try different CPA offers within the same niche (for example, 3 weight-loss apps or 3 finance platforms).<br>
                                ‚Ä¢ Track which one gives you the best EPC (earnings per click).<br>
                                4. Leverage free traffic first<br>
                                ‚Ä¢ Keep pushing content daily through short-form videos (TikTok/Instagram Reels/YouTube Shorts).<br>
                                ‚Ä¢ Focus on hooks that highlight how fast or easy the action is (ex: "Download this app in 10 seconds and unlock XYZ").<br>
                                5. Move into paid ads (optional)<br>
                                ‚Ä¢ Once you know which offer converts best, test cheap ads (Facebook Ads, TikTok Ads, Google Display).<br>
                                ‚Ä¢ CPA offers usually convert very well on paid traffic because the barrier is low (no credit card needed).<br>
                                6. Automate & outsource<br>
                                ‚Ä¢ When you start seeing consistent profit, outsource video editing or account management to scale without burning out.<br>
                                ‚Ä¢ Build a small system so you can run multiple offers in parallel.<br>
                                <br>
                                üëâ The more traffic you send, the more actions you generate ‚Äî and with CPA, actions are much easier to get than purchases. That's why scaling can happen faster than with product-based affiliate marketing.</li>
                                
                                <li><strong>Step 12</strong> ‚Äî Stay consistent and never give up<br>
                                Consistency is the key. If one of your TikTok accounts gets banned or disabled, don't panic. Simply file an appeal ‚Äî in 99% of cases, TikTok will restore your account within minutes.<br>
                                <br>
                                Most beginners quit when their account is closed, thinking it's permanent. The truth is, your account usually comes back within 10 minutes after an appeal.<br>
                                <br>
                                ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: always keep your VPN turned on while managing your accounts.</li>
